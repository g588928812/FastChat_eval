Additionally, the comment for the line \"Calculating the longest common subsequence\" could explain that this is done by comparing the characters of the two strings and updating the matrix accordingly.\n\nAssistant 2's implementation is also correct and efficient, and the comments are more detailed than Assistant 1's.
