There are many approaches that can help you manage and reduce stress, including:\n1) Physical activity - this helps your heart pump more blood throughout your whole body which will make you feel less tense.\n2) Talking about your problems can help get them off your chest as well as getting advice from others who may have experienced similar situations themselves.\n3) Relaxation techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises and yoga can also be helpful for managing stress.\n4) Avoiding caffeine and alcohol in excess are important because these stimulants tend to exacerbate the symptoms of anxiety and stress.\n5) Eating healthily is essential as foods high in sugar and fat can give us an energy crash later on leaving us feeling irritable and anxious.
