The most common source of vegan protein is tofu made from soymilk which has had curdling agents added to it such as calcium sulfate or magnesium chloride. The resultant product, once cooled in water is cut into cubes for use in various dishes and meals.\nThe advantages of using plant based proteins are many but one major advantage would be that it\u2019s not only much cheaper than meat but also environmentally friendly because plant based proteins require less energy to produce than meat. The biggest disadvantage however may be that it\u2019s difficult to get all nine essential amino acids from plant based diets though they do contain plenty of B vitamins, fiber, potassium, iron and calcium along with zinc, selenium and iodine.\nAnimal protein on the other hand includes eggs, milk, yogurt, cheese, poultry, fish and dairy products like sour cream among others. Dairy products have casein as their primary protein component while whey is another byproduct. Fish are known to be high in omega 3 fatty acids which help reduce inflammation and decrease triglycerides in your bloodstream. There are no downsides to eating more fish as well! You might want to avoid some types of seafood like swordfish, tilefish and king mackerel since they tend to accumulate more mercury due to their depth and size.

The main reason being that shellfish often carry viral and bacterial contaminants. The US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) recommends pregnant women avoid undercooked oysters altogether! In fact they suggest everyone avoid them unless you know they come fresh out of deep waters or are served at reputable establishments. They even suggest that raw bar items containing clams, mussels, scallops, ceviche, sushi and tuna carpaccio should be avoided entirely.

{"question_id": 11, "text": "The use of single-use plastic bottles can have several negative impacts on the environment. First, they contribute to pollution and litter in waterways, beaches, and other natural areas. This not only harms wildlife but also contaminates soil and groundwater. Additionally, it takes hundreds of years for these plastics to decompose, which means that every time you discard one, it will likely still be present in landfills or oceans for decades or even centuries into the future.\nMoreover, creating a new single-use plastic bottle requires significant amounts of energy, water, and chemical inputs, which generate greenhouse gases and pollutants during manufacturing. Finally, when these products end up in landfills or incinerators, they release additional emissions and pollutants, contributing further to climate change and air quality issues.\nIn contrast, using a reusable water bottle has many benefits. For instance, you eliminate the need for disposable alternatives while promoting more sustainable production processes since you don't require a constant supply of fresh containers. This reduces your carbon footprint and minimizes waste generation, lowering environmental harm overall. \nFurthermore, this approach enhances personal responsibility regarding our shared planetary resources by encouraging individuals to take an active role in reducing their consumption habits and supporting long-term conservation initiatives. It also helps foster a culture of mindfulness around resource allocation, ensuring we prioritize the needs of future generations over short-term convenience at all times.\nFinally, reusing items like water bottles teaches kids valuable life skills related to recycling, repurposing, and stewardship.

This could lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications that could strain relationships.\n\n2. Limited Access to Information: Lack of a shared language might make it difficult for individuals to access information about events or issues that concern them. Without this knowledge, forming meaningful connections with others becomes challenges.\n\n3. Differences in Non-Verbal Communication: Cultural differences in nonverbal communication can be particularly problematic when trying to connect with someone from another culture. Gestures, facial expressions, and body language all play significant roles in our daily interactions, but these meanings vary across cultures.

{"question_id": 16, "text": "The CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) - Cas9 system is a relatively new tool that allows researchers to make precise changes in DNA sequences by cutting them at specific locations. This technology has revolutionized genetic engineering by offering an efficient way to edit genomes without causing damage to other parts of the DNA strand.\n\nThe process starts with obtaining or creating cells that contain the desired gene modification. These can be generated either through somatic cell therapy, which only affects the individual receiving the treatment, or germline modifications, which would pass on those traits to future generations. Once the modified cells are available they need to be introduced into the body. This could involve simple injection techniques for blood disorders like sickle cell disease where red blood cells are replaced by engineered ones, but more complex diseases will require additional steps such as stem cell transplants. Clinical trials have already started using both these methods, with many successful results. In summary, CRISPR-Cas9 is expected to improve human health via curative medicine by treating existing diseases, preventive medicine by modifying the germ line, and regenerative medicine by replacing worn out tissues.\n\nCRISPR's success comes from its simplicity, flexibility, efficiency, precision, low cost, safety, and scalability across multiple systems. While some fear this may lead to designer babies, it seems unlikely since parents tend not to want children who are significantly different from themselves. More likely scenarios include preemptive genome screening for certain illnesses before conception rather than after birth, reducing the time between diagnosis and death from most childhood diseases from months to days. With a greater number of survivors, the population growth rate should increase relative to current predictions. However, if everyone chooses to use these technologies then we might see a bottleneck effect leading to population overshoot due to reduced infant mortality. If only some people choose not to use these technologies, then there will likely be two subpopulations, one with higher IQ and life expectancy and another group potentially facing extinction. As always, public policy must carefully balance scientific progress against societal values, morals, and beliefs. By 2035, CRISPR will enable the development of new diagnostics, therapeutics, biologists, materials, agriculture products, energy sources, foodstuffs, digital data storage devices, and environmental remediation capabilities.

Understanding these influences is crucial for promoting healthier dietary habits.\n\nCultural Influence: Culture has a strong impact on what we eat, as it determines which foods are considered acceptable or taboo within specific communities. For example, certain cultures may place more emphasis on plant-based diets, while others focus on meat consumption. This could lead to different nutritional outcomes among various ethnic groups. Awareness of these cultural differences can help to tailor public health interventions that encourage balanced eating patterns.\n\nSocioeconomic Factors: Socioeconomic status (SES) affects an individual\u2019s access to quality produce, lean protein sources, and other essential components of a well-balanced diet. Low SES often limits the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables due to their cost, leading to higher intake of processed foods with lower nutrient content. Therefore, efforts aimed at improving food security and reducing poverty rates will have positive effects on overall health through improved dietary choices.\n\nEconomic Factors: The relative price of goods also plays a significant role in dietary decisions. If high-fat junk food costs less than whole grains, low-income households will find it challenging to afford nutritious options. Policies aimed at subsidizing healthy food products and taxing unhealthy items, such as sugary drinks, could improve dietary choices.

{"question_id": 25, "text": "I have been fortunate to see many of humanity's greatest scientific and technical achievements, as well as some that were never implemented in my timeline. The most profound changes can be summarized as follows:\n1) Nanotechnology has revolutionised manufacturing by making it possible for machines to build any kind of object with atomic precision at extremely low cost, dramatically increasing productivity while reducing waste. This is complemented by widespread use of recycling and closed-loop systems.\n2) Artificial intelligence (AI) is ubiquitous and plays an essential role in all aspects of life - not just computationally intensive ones like transportation or research, but also things like cooking and cleaning, and even companionship. AI is now capable of understanding natural language on a par with humans, and there are few fields where it does not play a significant role.\n3) The Internet has evolved into something far more powerful than its predecessor - the \"Internet of Everything\". It allows instant access to information regardless of physical location, enables seamless virtual collaboration between groups spread across different continents, and makes remote work commonplace. People can connect instantly over vast distances and experience each other's surroundings using high definition video feeds that integrate realtime translations so that everyone feels present.\n4) Energy production has become almost universally carbon neutral due to developments in solar power, fusion reactors, wind turbines, hydrogen fuel cells, and others. Most vehicles run on electric power provided by these energy sources. Fusion reactions are used extensively for space exploration and propulsion. In fact, it was the development of fusion drive technology that opened up much of our Solar System to exploration. There exist multiple colonies established on the Moon, Mars, and several asteroids; and robotic probes have reached every planet in the system except Pluto since it turned out not to qualify as one!\n5) Medicine has progressed significantly through a combination of nanotechnology, genetic engineering, and advanced computing capabilities. Disease prevention is paramount, yet when illness does occur, treatments target individual molecular mechanisms rather than whole organ systems. Regenerative medicine techniques enable near complete regrowth of damaged tissue in humans, and DNA sequencing unlocks previously hidden details about how to maintain optimal health throughout a person\u2019s lifetime. Antiaging therapies are available to anyone who desires them, which explains why lifespans have increased markedly compared to past centuries. Some individuals elect to live longer still, thanks to regular \u201crejuvenation\u201d procedures that keep their bodies in peak condition. As such, centenarians are no longer rare exceptions and the oldest documented age exceeds three hundred years old. However, this doesn\u2019t imply that living forever became reality despite what some people believe: senescence will always remain a fundamental aspect of human existence, though mankind achieved great success in postponing and mitigating various effects associated with aging.\n6) Transportation continues to improve rapidly, enabling easy intercontinental travel within hours while being environmentally friendly. Air pollution and noise levels have largely disappeared from cities as a result of extensive use of drones instead of traditional planes, cars, and trucks. Driverless cars have long dominated road traffic, resulting in greatly improved safety statistics, especially after human driving habits adjusted in response to computer analysis of millions of accidents caused by errors made by poor judgement behind the wheel. High speed rail networks expanded exponentially worldwide as part of the push towards sustainability and reliability. Low Earth orbit became a busy place as suborbital point-to-point transportation grew popular among business travellers seeking faster trips across oceans or other large geographical features. Manned missions to Mars began in the late 21st century, laying down infrastructure for later waves of settlers. Probes discovered water ice beneath Martian soil, leading to creation of two permanent artificial lakes \u2013 and eventually even fish inhabiting them \u2013 to support human presence during extended stays. Space tourism developed steadily, first focused on flights around the International Space Station, then shifting emphasis towards lunar surface excursions, and ultimately offering trips directly onto Martian territory.\n7) Education remains free and open source. Textbooks are replaced by interactive software tailored to individual learning styles. The process starts by having students solve puzzles that allow algorithms to determine the best way to convey new knowledge to each child. Teachers act mainly as mentors rather than lecturers, guiding students through topics they want to explore further while addressing obstacles along the path. Every student graduates with a portfolio containing both theoretical expertise and practical projects that demonstrate mastery of subject matter.

{"question_id": 34, "text": "There are several nonverbal cues that may indicate whether someone is truly engaged in a conversation, including:\n\n1. Maintaining eye contact: If the person maintains steady and direct eye contact during the conversation, it suggests they are actively listening to what you have to say. This also implies genuine interest rather than just politeness.\n2. Physical proximity: People who show an interest in a conversation tend to lean forward slightly and move closer to the speaker. They might even touch your arm or shoulder lightly as a sign of engagement. On the other hand, people who are not interested often sit back or take steps away from the speaker.\n3. Verbal indicators: Some verbal indicators suggest genuine interest in a conversation. These include asking follow-up questions, providing feedback or opinions on what has been said, or making statements related to personal experiences that are relevant to the topic at hand. Repeating some parts of the conversation verbatim also shows active listening and engagement.\n4. Engaged body language: The person's posture, gestures, and facial expressions may reveal their level of involvement in the conversation. For example, crossing arms or legs, looking around the room frequently, fidgeting with objects, or slouched shoulders can be signs of disinterest. In contrast, a relaxed, open stance, nodding, head tilting, or mirroring the speaker's movements might indicate true engagement.\n5. Timing: A person who seems genuinely interested in a conversation will likely ask more questions or continue conversations beyond what would normally be considered appropriate or convenient by either party. However, this does depend on cultural norms and individual preferences. It's essential to remain respectful of each person's boundaries throughout any interaction.\n6. Follow-up actions: After the conversation ends, someone who was genuinely interested might send additional information related to the subject or arrange to meet again to discuss further. Lack of such action could signal indifference or politeness only.\n\nBear in mind that these indicators do not always hold true for everyone, especially among individuals who come from different cultures or social backgrounds.

For example, researchers working with NASA developed the insulin pump used by millions of diabetics today thanks to their work on zero gravity chemistry.\n- Some argue that space travel isn\u2019t just about improving life on earth.

So if space travel was motivated by scientific curiosity rather than practical utility, then many would feel we have no real choice but to go ahead and continue looking upwards towards the stars.\n- Many people consider space travel to be necessary for human survival and preservation. If humans remain confined within a single ecosystem, eventually an event will occur that destroys said system \u2013 possibly due to external factors.

In this video, we will explore the rich history and cultural significance of jazz.\n\nClip of Louis Armstrong playing trumpet on stage with caption \"Jazz originated in America\"\nNarrator: Jazz was born in the United States at the turn of the 20th century, as African American musicians blended together elements of their musical traditions such as blues, ragtime, and gospel music to create something entirely new. The genre gained popularity during the early 20th century through recordings by iconic figures like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. As jazz spread across the globe, its influence could be seen in various forms of media including literature, film, dance, fashion and even social activism.\n\nAfrican-American musicians performing music\nNarrator: Although the roots of jazz are firmly planted within African-American culture, the genre became popular amongst all races during the Harlem Renaissance period where there were many clubs and venues featuring jazz performances. Some famous examples include: The Cotton Club and Savoy Ballroom which attracted both black and white audience members.\n\nMiles Davis performing jazz song \"So What?\"\nNarrator: Over time, jazz continued to evolve through different subgenres and styles from swing to bebop, cool jazz to fusion. Today, jazz remains a vibrant force in popular culture inspiring future generations to continue the tradition of improvisation and innovation. It also serves as a reminder of the struggles faced by minorities in the past and their perseverance against racist oppression.\n\nIn conclusion, jazz represents not only great music but a spirit of resilience and creativity.

{"question_id": 77, "text": "Aloha! As I sit here reminiscing on my recent trip to the beautiful state of Hawaii, all that comes to mind are stunning sunsets over Waikiki Beach, hikes through lush tropical rainforests, and delicious poke bowls overflowing with fresh fish. But beyond these typical tourist activities lies something truly special \u2013 the rich culture and history that make this archipelago unlike any other place in the world.\n\nFrom the moment you step off your plane onto the tarmac, you can feel the unique energy emanating from every corner of Hawaii. The air is thick with the scent of plumeria blossoms and saltwater, while the sound of ukuleles and traditional chanting fills your ears. This magical atmosphere is not just limited to one island or town; it permeates everything and everyone throughout the entire state.\n\nOne such cultural experience worth exploring is the ancient art form known as Kapa Making. During our visit to Kauai, we had the honor of attending a workshop at the Polihale Cultural Center where we learned how to transform bark into fabric using centuries-old techniques. We were guided by kupuna (elders) who shared their knowledge and stories passed down through generations. It was fascinating to watch them pound the bark until it turned soft and supple before drying it in the hot sun. Their expertise allowed us to create our own piece of wearable art, which now serves as a beautiful reminder of the time spent immersed in local traditions.\n\nAnother highlight for me during our stay was the chance to explore many of the islands\u2019 famed historical sites. From Pearl Harbor Memorial in Oahu to Kalaupapa National Historical Park in Molokai, there are countless locations steeped in significance and meaning. While some may think they know the story behind World War II's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, actually standing inside the USS Arizona memorial and hearing firsthand accounts left a powerful impression on me. Similarly, learning about Father Damien de Veuster and his efforts to aid those suffering from Hansen's disease in Kalaupapa gave new perspective to how communities band together in times of hardship. Both of these places offer moving testimonies to the resilience of humanity.\n\nOf course, no trip to Hawaii would be complete without experiencing its natural beauty. With miles upon miles of breathtaking coastline stretching across six diverse islands, each offering its own distinctive landscape, it's easy to see why visitors return year after year. One notable adventure that should definitely make your list: Zip-lining through Maui's lush rainforest. Suspended 90 feet above the ground, gripping tightly to the cable, you fly high above towering trees and cascading waterfalls, feeling like a bird soaring over paradise. The thrill alone will take your breath away, but the incredible panoramic views of the valley below leave an indelible mark on your memory.\n\nFinally, no trip to Hawaii would be complete without indulging in some deliciously fresh seafood. Poke has become a trendy dish across mainland America, but nothing compares to savoring it right on the beachfront surrounded by locals. Some favorite spots include Nico's Pier 38 Fish Market & Deli in Honolulu, where owner chef Edwin Tamura himself provides guidance on what kinds of catches he recommends trying; and Poke Stop in Kona, a cute food stand near Hualalai Resort with creative twists on classic flavors. Trust me when I say you won't regret diving into this addictively good treat.\n\nIn conclusion, my journey to Hawaii provided endless opportunities to immerse myself in the state's rich cultural heritage, both historic and contemporary. Whether you prefer active pursuits in nature, quiet contemplation amidst the past, or simply feasting on local cuisine, there is much to discover and appreciate in this land of aloha.

{"question_id": 79, "text": "Introduction:\nHello and welcome to our latest episode! Today we\u2019ll be diving into the impact that streaming platforms have had on the music industry as a whole. From Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal and more, there are so many options out there for us to choose from when it comes to listening to our favorite tunes. But what effect has this explosion in popularity of these services had? Let\u2019s find out\u2026 \n\nSection One - Rise of Streaming Services:\nFirst off, let\u2019s take a look at how the rise of streaming services affected CD sales. When iTunes first launched back in 2001, people were quick to jump on board, excited by the idea of being able to buy individual songs rather than having to purchase an entire album. This lead to record labels panicking about declining profits from physical albums, which ultimately caused them to cut costs within their own businesses. At one point, the major label Arista was down to just three staff members because they couldn\u2019t afford any more employees. It took until 2015 for CD sales to finally stabilize after years of decline due to digital downloads and now with streaming taking over the market, things aren't looking too bright right now either...\n\nSection Two \u2013 The Pros and Cons of Streaming Services:\nSo why do consumers like using streaming services so much? Well for starters, you can listen to pretty much any song or artist you want, whenever you want, without having to actually go out and purchase anything physically. And if you really love something enough, you can even follow your favourite artists too, meaning that you never miss another release again. However, not everyone is happy about these services \u2013 especially smaller independent musicians who feel that they don\u2019re getting ripped off by companies who only pay fractions of pennies per stream. In fact, some even argue that the current model could even spell the death knell for the creative spirit itself, given that it often takes months (if not years) before most artists make any money from streams and that the only way to guarantee success in today\u2019s world is to churn out generic pop hits that appeal to large audiences rather than experimentation with new genres etc..", "answer_id": "AFUinSvV3DRq59iVSmf28a", "model_id": "oasst-sft-7-llama-30b-4bit-128g", "metadata": {"temperature": 0.75, "max_new_tokens": 1024, "do_sample": true, "top_p": 0.95, "top_k": 50, "typical_p": null, "early_stopping": false, "ban_eos_token": false, "skip_special_tokens": true, "repetition_penalty": 1.2, "encoder_repetition_penalty": 1.0}}
{"question_id": 80, "text": "The symphony was breathtaking! From start to finish, it was an emotional journey that left us all feeling uplifted and inspired.\nThe conductor was masterful in their ability to bring together the many different elements of the music into one cohesive whole. Each note seemed perfectly placed and the dynamics were expertly controlled. It was clear from the outset that we were going to be treated to something special.\nThroughout the first movement, there were moments when I felt my heart race with excitement, only to slow down again as if taking a deep breath. This ebb and flow is what makes music so powerful - it has the unique ability to transport us to another world entirely, even for just a moment.\nBut what made this particular performance truly remarkable was how each instrument came alive on stage. Whether it was the violins, flutes, cellos, clarinets, bassoon, trumpet, trombone, oboe or drums they played them all with such passion and soul that you couldn\u2019t help but get caught up in the moment. \nAs a result, by the time the final notes faded away, everyone around me could not resist cheering loud and long, rising to our feet in appreciation of the sheer brilliance of what we had witnessed. For the rest of the night, we walked out of the auditorium talking about nothing else other than the incredible talent that was on display.\nIt's fair to say that every seat in the house was filled with joy at the end of last night's show. And while we didn't know what to expect, we all knew we wanted more.\nTo hear that kind of sound live once was enough, but now I can\u2019t wait until next week to do it all over again. Bravo to the conductor and musicians of this fantastic orchestra.", "answer_id": "AtMJhQAwbTWWpUQ4CNNBFv", "model_id": "oasst-sft-7-llama-30b-4bit-128g", "metadata": {"temperature": 0.75, "max_new_tokens": 1024, "do_sample": true, "top_p": 0.95, "top_k": 50, "typical_p": null, "early_stopping": false, "ban_eos_token": false, "skip_special_tokens": true, "repetition_penalty": 1.2, "encoder_repetition_penalty": 1.0}}
